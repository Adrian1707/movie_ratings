All cinema websites will not show the ratings of the movies they are showing, making it another chore for the user who wants to find
out if a movie is worth seeing. This program allows the user to select a cinema which then gives a list of all the films
showing in that cinema, as well as their IMDB ratings.

This is a simple command line program that fetches data from the Cineworld API, to collect cinema names and movies showing, as well as the IMDB api to fetch the ratings for each of those movies.

The code was thrown together in about 2 hours and looks revolting in its current state. There are no tests and best practices fell out the
window as I wanted to see how fast I can get this working. This was purely for some Saturday afternoon hacky fun.
